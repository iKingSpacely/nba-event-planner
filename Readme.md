# Game Connect App

## Description
Welcome to Game Connect! An app that allows users to create an account and search for their favorite NBA team schedules to find a game that they would like to attend in the future. Each game will provide you with a date and time so you can plan accordingly. 

In a future update, we’ll be including a save feature that allows you to save all the games that you want to attend on an easily accessible page in your users’ profile. 

Additionally, each user will be able to post comments about the games that they’ve either attended or games that they’re looking for friends on the platform to go with, creating that social aspect of Game Connect linking NBA enthusiasts together!
